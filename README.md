# CancerNuclearDetection
 The ability to automatically detect and segment cells and tis- sues has been an active research field in medical informatics for decades, but it has recently attracted increased attention due to the  develop- ments in computer and microscopy hardware. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning- based techniques. In cancer research, these approaches play a key role in minimizing human intervention and providing traceable clinical informa- tion. The purpose of this report is to detect and segment nuclei, using machine learning algorithms. First, three different architectures (namely U-NET, CNN with no pooling layer and pixel-based CNN) of deep neural networks, for the medical image segmentation, are presented, and then their performances are evaluated on Kaggle challenging database. Sec- ond, to improve the segmentation accuracy by these methods, some new strategies are proposed in pre-processing and post processing steps (spe- cially, separating connected nuclei). Experimental results and our score on Kaggle website shows the improvement of the segmentation accuracy with respect to original networks.
